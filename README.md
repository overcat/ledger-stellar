## Introduction

This is the wallet app for the [Ledger Nano S](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s), [Ledger Nano S Plus](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-s-plus) and [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x) that makes it possible to store [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/)-based assets on those devices and generally sign any transaction for the Stellar network.

A companion [JavaScript library](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/blob/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/hw-app-str/README.md) is available to communicate with this app.
